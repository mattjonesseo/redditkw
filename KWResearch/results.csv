This was not redirected properly so that the preferred version is always served. 

As a result, in Google Analytics, when comparing data, half of the URLs appear as 404's. 

**Not sure if this is still considered duplicate content because BOTH versions are not being served simultaneously. Just the old ones appear as 404's and the new URLs appear as normal.**

Over the past quarter, we saw a 50% decrease in organic traffic and was wondering if this could be the issue. Some of the pages (new URL) are still ranking like they were before.

SEO Real Estate input,1,ctst4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/ctst4e/seo_real_estate_input/,4,1566479557.0,"Hey all,

I have recently taken the liberty in learning SEO and backlinking via udemy in hopes of gaining some good web traction in gaining a decent customer base. I don't have a huge inner sphere that are in a position to buy or sell. Also being 25 years old in the business not a lot of folks I feel are willing to take a chance on me via active prospecting. Feeling like I have a basic grasp of the subject, I had a few opinions from individuals when I shared my new business model direction.

I wanted to get some input into an ""opinion"" I had  recently received in regards to focusing on SEO in my real estate business.

Here it is-

""Your SEO strategy and execution, plus your funding would have to be better than the top SERP listings.. cuz if it’s not.. you gonna waste your time. I find that even for hyper local terms, Zillow, Redfin, Realtor dot com, moveto, and some large brokerages are dominating. No way you are ever gonna knock down ZRR.. at least all you have to do is be better than the next 2 or 3 but still, a battle. And what if you SEO the biggiebbies on a term that doesn’t pay off.. you waste months and months, time you will never get back, only to start anew on another set of terms . On the other hand.. Gadwords is super cheap for hyper local searches.. spend a few hundred bucks, figure out what converts.. and pays.. then SEO the biggibbies out of that once you know it makes money.""


From what I learned on udemy, as long as you study keywords that have a low competition and high volume, you should stay rather relevant. On top of that, I had learned having a good healthy google approved backlink portfolio and gaining website authority will raise your payed ads tenfold. I never really thought I had to compete with top real estate brokerages, I just studied individual realtors and their site activity. 

I figured I could out maneuver a lot of local competition with local backlinking, content and gaining site authority. Seeing as a lot of realtors locally aren't doing much of anything with it, even the top producing agents. So I felt like I discovered something I could get ahead with in SEO. I also have a Longtailpro account to help with keywords when I decide to create ads.

Hopefully you folks can give me some input, it would be greatly appreciated. I would also be happy to know of any good cheap learning sources for SEO outside of udemy maybe geared more toward businesses like real estate.


Thanks friends",2019-08-22 14:12:37
